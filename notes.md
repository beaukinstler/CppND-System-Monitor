`man uptime` compared to `/cat/proc/uptime` shows me the first val is the 
current time in 24 hour format, and the second is how long the system has been 
running. 
eg `13956.21 54506.99` (uptime, current time) was about the same as this output from the `uptime` command

(current time, uptime)
`15:08:48 up  3:52,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.06`
